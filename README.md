# Student-Result-Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing student results using Python and data visualization techniques. The goal is to extract meaningful insights from student performance data and present them in an easy-to-understand manner using various Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
# Features
Data Cleaning: Handles missing values and incorrect data entries.
Descriptive Analysis: Provides summary statistics such as mean, median, and mode for each student result attribute.
Visualizations: Generates various types of charts (e.g., bar charts, histograms) to represent student performance trends.
Result Classification: Classifies students into categories such as "Pass", "Fail", "Distinction" based on their scores.
Comparison Analysis: Compares student performance based on different categories such as subject, gender, or class.
